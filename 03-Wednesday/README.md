## Wednesday: Weird, Wacky, Wrong?

On Wednesday we can really start comparing different algorithms and how and when they work. How do you decide what algorithm to use? What is bias-variance tradeoff? What is overfitting?

Once we know something about overfitting and some of the issues that come up in algorithm selection, we can add neural networks to our repertoire.

### Schedule

Morning: comparing algorithms, visualization

Afternoon: neural networks. Fun arty things, maybe sentiment analysis?
