For example, when we compute the average of some exam scores, we might want the program to tell us if the student passed the course or not. For this, we use \"if\" statements, as below. In the following code, the line `if average >= 60` checks if the value of the variable average is greater than or equal to 60, and only runs the indented code if it is. The line `else` tells us that the indented code below runs otherwise.\n",

    "\n",
    "In mathematics, we often see simple functions denoted like $f(x) = x + 5$. The function, $f(x)$, takes as **input** the value $x$ and returns as output the value $x+5$. In programming, the terms **input**, **paramater**, and **argument** are all used interchangably to refer to the same thing. Likewise, the **output** is sometimes referred to as the **return value** instead. We'll see why shortly. \n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that math follows different naming conventions than Python. We can name our functions whatever we want in Python, so when possible we should give them meaningful names that communicate to the user what their purpose is. We should also make sure to give the **inputs/arguments/parameters** meaningful names as well. Let's rewrite the function above:"

    "Also notice that when we calculated the average score for each student using for-loops, we manually divided their scores by 3 because that's how many exams they took. When we define our `average()` function, however, we make use of the built-in Python function `len()` to determine what number to divide by. Because `len()` is built-in, we don't need to define it ourselves and can use it right out of the box (`print()` is actually another example of a built-in function we've already been using!). The `len()` function takes in a list as input and returns the length of that list as the output. This means our `average()` function can take in a list of *any* length and accurately calculate its average, unlike our for-loops which could only calculate the average of a list of 3. \n",
