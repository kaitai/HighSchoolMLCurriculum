    "You have probably regularly used variables in math classes to represent unknown quantities.\n",
    "We also use variables in programming, but they are used a bit differently. In programming, we regularly want to store a piece of information, like a number or a word. But we need a way to refer back to that piece of information, which is what variables allow us to do. In programming, a variable gives a name to a storage space for a piece of information, allowing us to access and manipulate that piece of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the following piece of code, we want to store the number 5. We use a variable named x to store the number 5. We then can access this value, for example using our print function."

    "\n",
    "We use the equals sign to assign values to a variable. Note that this also behaves differently from the equals sign that you've seen in math. In programming, it's best to think of the equals sign instead as a left pointing arrow, which assigns the value of the expression on the right to the variable on the left: $$x\\leftarrow 5.$$ The code `x = 5` should be read as \"assign the value 5 to the variable x.\" Because of this, writing `x = 5` makes sense, but writing `5 = x` is nonsense from a programming perspective, and this will generate an error. \n",

Here, the message \"can't assign to literal\" is telling us that writing `5 = x` doesn't make sense - this line of code means \"assign the value of x to the number 5,\" but the programming language blocks us from changing the value of the number 5, which is a very good thing!\n",
    "\n",

Then, then line `x = x + 1` assigns the value of x+1 to the variable x. Note that this line of code will first compute the value of x + 1, which would be 6, and then assigns that value to x. We then print the value of x to verify that it has been updated."
