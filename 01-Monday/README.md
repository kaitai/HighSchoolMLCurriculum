## Theme of the day: Data

We start with introductions of staff, directions to the restroom, and an overview of the schedule. Then move to an overview of the schedule of the camp so students know where we're going (projects on Thursday-Friday).

Then a short talk on what machine learning is: Kaisa will do this in 2019. 

Vern will then start our discussion of data. We all hear about data privacy in the news, but what is data? What types of data can be collected? What do different types of data look like to the computer? We'll talk about numerical data, string data, binary data, etc.

Students will complete a survey about their preferences (movie preferences, food preferences) and demographics. We'll use this data later in the morning. We may use iPads for this.

Then we'll do an activity with puzzles to start a discussion of how to conceptualize data and statistics.

At this point, we can walk to the computer lab, I think. There Mark will do a demonstration with the students' own data: what kind of data cleaning did he have to do? What was the data quality? Can we find averages for numerical values? Look at histograms for other types of data? How do we explore this data? 

We will make sure students can log in to their computers and start Jupyter. 

Then it's lunchtime!

After lunch, we'll start our intro to programming in Python using Jupyter notebooks. We'll get students started but there is a lot of time for independent work. During this time, TAs and instructors should circulate often and talk with students to learn about their previous experience and their goals for the future.

The goal is to do Jupyter worksheets one through five.

At 3 pm, we'll have our first industry panel discussion.
