## Tuesday Theme: Algorithms

On Tuesday we finish up with our introduction to Python and Jupyter and start delving into machine learning algorithms in earnest.

### Schedule

Start with icebreakers and something fun. Move to the computer lab and the remaining Jupyter notebooks.

We have notebooks on Python libraries, plotting, and vectorization. Importing Python libraries can be confusing for new users, and there's quite a forest of possible libraries. Plotting alos has a rather high bar in Python. Vectorization is totally optional, but I (Kaisa) find it truly useful in data science and machine learning applications.

Make sure all students get through the libraries and plotting notebooks as those are so useful.

When we're done with those intro notebooks, move to clustering and start with a group discussion. We start with clustering because it is very visual and can be discussed without talking about optimization if there are nice examples.

Then if time remains before lunch, move to decision trees.

### LUNCH!

Decision trees "by eyeball" on paper, with discussion of entropy or Gini for deciding on the split, and then decision trees in Jupyter notebook. This will be our first mathematical discussion of optimization. We do this first because one chooses the best split from a finite number of choices.

Separating hyperplanes (maximal margin separator, etc.) "by eyeball" on paper, with discussion of how to optimize the coefficients of the dividing line/plane. Again, more discussion of optimization; we do this after decision trees because it's optimization over a continuous space of coefficients.
